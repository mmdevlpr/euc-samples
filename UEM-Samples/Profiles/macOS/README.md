## macOS-Samples \ CustomXMLProfiles
This section of the **EUC-samples** repository contains samples relating to profile snippets which can be used in the "Custom Settings" or "Custom XML" payload in Workspace ONE UEM for macOS management.  Custom XML samples are typically used to manage key-value pairs in macOS preference domains.  For more information on Custom XML, refer to [Custom XML Preferences - VMware EUC Blog](https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2017/06/xml-preferences.html) and the [Custom XML Template](https://github.com/vmware-samples/euc-samples/blob/master/macOS-Samples/CustomXMLProfiles/CustomXMLTemplate.md).
