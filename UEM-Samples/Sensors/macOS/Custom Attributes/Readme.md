## macOS-Samples \ CustomAttributes
This section of the **EUC-samples** repository contains samples relating to script and command line snippets which can be used in the "Custom Attributes" payload in Workspace ONE UEM for macOS management.  Custom Attribute scripts allow admins to gather arbitrary information from a device (e.g. information not included by default in MDM samples).  Whatever value is echo'ed at the end of the script is the value captured for the Custom Attribute.


Please feel free to submit any scripts you wish to share with the community!
