- **Supported Platforms**: Workspace ONE 1811+
- **Tested on**: Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise 1803+


## Purpose
These Workspace ONE Sensor samples contain PowerShell command lines or scripts that can be used in a **Devices > Sensors** payload to report back information about the Windows 10, macOS or Linux device back to Workspace ONE.

## Description 
There are Sensor samples, templates, and a script `import_sensor_samples.ps1` to populate your environment with all of the samples.    

## Required Changes/Updates
You will want to leverage the `template_`  samples and modify any of the data, or leverage the existing samples. You can also leverage the `import_sensor_samples.ps1` script to upload the samples to your environment. Only the templates and the Sensor Importer require changes. Samples work as is, but can also be modified for your needs. 

For Windows Samples be sure to use the following format when creating new samples so that they are imported correctly:

   `# Description: Description`  
   `# Execution Context: SYSTEM | USER`  
   `# Execution Architecture: EITHER64OR32BIT | ONLY_32BIT | ONLY_64BIT | LEGACY`  
   `# Return Type: INTEGER | BOOLEAN | STRING | DATETIME`  
   `<YOUR POWERSHELL COMMANDS>`

For macOS Samples be sure to use the following format when creating new samples so that they are imported correctly:
   `<YOUR SENSOR COMMANDS>`  
   `# Description: Description`  
   `# Execution Context: SYSTEM | USER`  
   `# Return Type: INTEGER | BOOLEAN | STRING | DATETIME`  
   `# Variables: KEY,VALUE; KEY,VALUE`

For Linux Samples be sure to use the following format when creating new samples so that they are imported correctly:
   `<YOUR SCRIPT COMMANDS>`  
   `# Description: Description`  
   `# Execution Context: SYSTEM | USER`  
   `# Return Type: INTEGER | BOOLEAN | STRING | DATETIME`  
   `# Variables: KEY,VALUE; KEY,VALUE`  
   `# Platform: LINUX`

## Workspace ONE Sensors Importer

### Synopsis 
This Powershell script allows you to automatically import PowerShell/Shell (.sh & .zsh)/Python scripts (Sensor Samples) as Workspace ONE Sensors in the Workspace ONE UEM Console. MUST RUN AS ADMIN

### Description 
Place this PowerShell script in the same directory of all of your samples (.ps1, .sh, .zsh, .py files, note file extension is not required, sha-bang will be used to determine scripting language) or use the `-SensorsDirectory` parameter to specify your directory. This script when run will parse the sensor sample scripts, check if they already exist, then upload to Workspace ONE UEM via the REST API. If the `-UpdateSensors` parameter is provided, existing sensors with the same name will have all metadata and Sensor Code updated in the console.

***The OrganizationGroupName and SmartGroupName parameters use a search function. If multiple Organization Group or Smart Groups are returned, a choice prompt will allow selection of the correct Group.***

### Examples 

- **Basic**: this command shows all required fields and will scan the default directory and upload the samples to Workspace ONE via the REST API using the credentials provided. 

   `.\import_sensor_samples.ps1`  
   `-WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc='`  
   `-OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone'`

- **Custom Directory**: using the `-SensorsDirectory` parameter tells the script where your samples exist. The directory provided must have script files which you want uploaded as Sensors. 

   `.\import_sensor_samples.ps1`  
   `-WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc='`  
   `-OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone'`  
   `-SensorsDirectory 'C:\Users\G.P.Burdell\Downloads\Sensors'`

- **Assign to Smart Group**: using the `-SmartGroupID` or `-SmartGroupName` parameter will assign all Sensors uploaded to that chosen Smart Group. This command is used best in a test environment to quickly test Sensors before moving Sensors to production. Obtain the Smart Group ID via API or by hovering over the Smart Group name in the console and looking at the ID at the end of the URL to use `-SmartGroupID`. ***The SmartGroupName parameter uses a search function. If multiple Smart Groups are returned, a choice prompt will allow selection of the correct Smart Group.***

   `.\import_sensor_samples.ps1`  
   `-WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc='`  
   `-OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone'`  
   `-SmartGroupName 'All Devices'`

- **Assign to Smart Group and Set EVENT Triggers**: using the `-SmartGroupID` or `-SmartGroupName` parameter will assign the Sensors uploaded to that chosen Smart Group. You can choose to trigger on Event or Schedule. When using **EVENT** as a TriggerType provide the trigger(s): **LOGIN**, **LOGOUT**, **STARTUP**, **USER_SWITCH**. When using **SCHEDULE** or if not specifying a TriggerType, then the default Sensor interval of 6 hours will be used, and the Event triggers will be ignored.

   `.\import_sensor_samples.ps1`  
   `-WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc='`  
   `-OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone'`  
   `-SmartGroupName 'All Devices'`  
   `-TriggerType 'EVENT'`  
   `-LOGIN -LOGOUT -STARTUP -USER_SWITCH`

- **Delete All Sensors**: using the `-DeleteSensors` switch parameter will delete ALL Sensors in the target Organization Group, including Sensors manually added!

   `.\import_sensor_samples.ps1`  
   `-WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc='`  
   `-OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone'`  
   `-DeleteSensors`

- **Update Sensors or Overwrite Existing Sensors**: using the `-UpdateSensors` switch parameter will update the Sensors that already exist with the version being uploaded. This is best used when updates and fixes are published to the source Sensor samples.

   `.\import_sensor_samples.ps1`  
   `-WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc='`  
   `-OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone'`  
   `-UpdateSensors`

- **Export All Sensors**: using the `-ExportSensors` switch parameter will export ALL Sensors that exist in the target Organization Group, including Sensors manually added! This is a good option for backing up sensors before making updates, or copying from UAT to PROD for example.

   `.\import_sensor_samples.ps1`  
   `-WorkspaceONEServer 'https://as###.awmdm.com'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdmin 'administrator'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAdminPW 'P@ssw0rd'`  
   `-WorkspaceONEAPIKey 'YeJtOTx/v2EpXPIEEhFo1GfAWVCfiF6TzTMKAqhTWHc='`  
   `-OrganizationGroupName 'Digital Workspace Tech Zone'`  
   `-ExportSensors`

### Parameters
