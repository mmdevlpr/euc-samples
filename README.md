## Introduction
Welcome to the **Legacy EUC-samples** repository.  This project is intended for the community and VMware to share commonly used code snippets that can aid VMware Workspace ONE and Horizon administrators. 

Some examples of items to submit for consideration and use by the community:
* Custom XML Profile Payloads
* Script content for Custom Attributes
* Scripts to be leveraged via Products  (Bash/shell, Python, Powershell, Batch, etc)
* Scripts to assist with automation against the various VMware REST API's
* Markdown Documents describing suggested best practices or procedures that may be outside the realm of typical documentation

With the impending divestiture of VMware EUC by Broadcom to KKR and the EUC business becoming a standalone entity called [omnissa](https://www.omnissa.com), this repo has been migrated to https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples.
Please update your git repo remote origin URL by running:

`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:euc-oss/euc-samples.git`
